<h3>Hello world!</h3>
<p>At school I am business major with a focus in the field of management information systems. I have always enjoyed computer science and business and I feel that MIS is the place for me. </p>
<p>out of school I enjoy spending my time surfing, skiing, hiking and really anything outdoors. </p>
