<h3>Life </h3>
<p>I have always love being outdoors from skiing to atving I have loved it all. Recently i have fell in love with surfing. surfing on the east coast is very unpredictable so when its is good you have to go. </p>
<p>this summer i decided to build a surfboard. I started with a block of foam and shaped it down to its final shape then i fiber glassed the board and it was complete </p>
